<a name="description" class="anchor" href="#description"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Description</h1>

<p>This package is designed to make it safe and easy(er) to rapidly prototype
changes to the underlying Hamiltonian in Amber as defined in the
parameter-topology file. A full description of its capabilities is described in
the accompanying manual (which is extracted from the full Amber manual that
is/will be released with Amber 14). The program is comprised of a command
interpreter (with full readline support), a GUI- frontend based on Tkinter with
clickable buttons for each action, and a flexible Python API whose use follows
naturally from the simple command interpreter syntax.</p>

<p>The underlying AmberParm class that ParmEd was built around was augmented with
OpenMM support so that it is able to directly create an OpenMM System instance
with a call signature identical to the one provided in the OpenMM
application layer. Improvements implemented here include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Periodic box information is set up from the input coordinate file rather
    than the parameter-topology file, since that is where the 'preferred' box
    information is stored in Amber</p></li>

<li><p>The parameter topology file class can read in both a topology file and a
    coordinate file at the same time (this is required to set the default box
    information from the inpcrd file)</p></li>

<li><p>The restart file class/parser is capable of reading both Amber restarts as
    well as Amber NetCDF restart files, with the format detected
    automatically</p></li>

<li><p>In many cases, System creation is noticeably faster with this class for
     large systems.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Also included are a handful of OpenMM reporters in the
<code>chemistry.amber.openmmreporters</code> module, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>AmberStateDataReporter</code> - Basically copied from StateDataReporter, but
   prints out data in standard AKMA units like those used in Amber and CHARMM
   (and provides options in the call signature to specify the set of units you want
   to use)</p></li>

<li><p><code>RestartReporter</code> - Allows Amber-style ASCII or NetCDF restart files to be
   written periodically during a simulation. It can either write a series of
   numbered restarts or continually overwrite the previous one. Fully
   compatible with all Amber programs.</p></li>

<li><p><code>MdcrdReporter</code> - Allows Amber-style ASCII trajectory files to be
written</p></li>

<li><p><code>NetCDFReporter</code> - Allows Amber-style NetCDF trajectories to be
written</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The principle difference between the NetCDF support included here and that
included in MDTraj is that the NetCDF parsing here is backend agnostic,
supporting the implementations in the scipy, netCDF4, and ScientificPython
packages (the first one is written in pure Python and does not require linking
to the NetCDF libraries). A default implementation is chosen if no explicit
choice is made in the order listed above.</p>

<h1>
<a name="charmm-support" class="anchor" href="#charmm-support"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CHARMM Support</h1>

<p>Also included in ParmEd is the ability to read native CHARMM input files
(PSF, RTF, PAR, STR, coordinate, and restart files).  It can use these files to
either create an OpenMM <code>System</code> object directly or it can be used to
generate a topology file that can be used in the <i>pmemd</i>, <i>sander</i>, or
<i>pmemd.cuda</i> programs in Amber.</p>

<h1>
<a name="notable-openmm-capabilities" class="anchor" href="#notable-openmm-capabilities"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Notable OpenMM Capabilities</h1>

<p>The <code>OpenMM</code> action in ParmEd will read a pmemd/sander-like command-line and an
Amber-style input file and run the simulation using OpenMM through the Python
application layer with equivalent settings.  It includes options to specify the
platform and precision model, and also has the option to generate a working
Python script that will run the equivalent calculation.</p>

<p>The <code>energy</code> action in ParmEd will compute a single-point energy from the loaded
coordinates, optionally decomposing the energy contributions into "bond",
"angle", "dihedral", and "nonbonded" contributions (finer-grained decomposition
of the nonbonded components is not currently possible except for
direct/reciprocal decomposition).</p>
